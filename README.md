# talk_with_csv

### Aim 
In this, we use Langchain and Streamlit to analyze CSV files, We will leverage the OpenAI API for GPT-3 access, and employ Streamlit for user interface development. This will enable users to upload CSV files and pose queries about the data. The system will generate the answers and illustrate the information with tables and charts.
